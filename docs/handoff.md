# Handoff — Component 6 (Solve Loop on Verify Set)

*Authored 2026-09-06 by the previous agent. If you are reading this
without the rest of the conversation, start here.*

## TL;DR

The previous session built the **evaluation harness** for RQ4. The
verify pool and 6 per-skill index files already exist on disk. Your
job is to **drive each agent against the test issues** in every index,
recording pass/fail, and produce the per-skill / per-category metrics
the paper needs.

Nothing is wired to a runtime yet — this is the first script we need
to write.

---

## 1. State of the world (as of 2026-09-06)

### What's done
- 200 classified issues (`data/index.jsonl`, gitignored).
- 6 fully-trained per-repo skills:
  ```
  agent/skills/{mini-swe-agent,openhands}/{40,60,80}/
  ```
  Each contains `SKILL.md`, `fallback_generic_fix.md`, `manifest.json`,
  and `repos/<owner>__<name>.md`.
- Verify pool (`data/verify/_pool/<issue-id>/`, gitignored) — 192
  unique dirs, **~4.6 MB**, all patch fields stripped, **exactly 3
  files per directory** (`env.dockerfile`, the
  `agentsmith_fail2pass_<NNN>.py` test, and the rewritten
  `issue.json`). Built and audited by
  `utils/verify/build_verify.py --force-pool --audit` using the
  default `--strict` 3-file mode. The legacy 7-file mode is still
  reachable via `--no-strict` for forensic debug only.
- 6 per-skill indices (`data/verify/issue_index_<agent>_<train_size>.jsonl`,
  gitignored) — 200 rows each, `split=0` (train) / `split=1` (test).
- `utils/verify/build_verify.py` is the canonical rebuilder. It is
  idempotent; `--force-pool` rebuilds the pool from scratch,
  `--audit` scans for surviving leak vectors.
- Latest two commits on `main`:
  ```
  29fdc3e gitignore: skip *.hallucinated.* validator-rejected backups
  9c4e188 component 5: build_verify.py — patch-stripped pool + 6 per-skill indices
  ```
- PDF (`docs/progress.pdf`, 11 pages) and markdown
  (`docs/progress.md`) are up to date and pushed to
  `github.com/EaminC/RQ4`.

### What's next (the actual ask)
**Component 6** — `utils/verify/solve.py`. For each of the 6 per-skill
indices, iterate every `split=1` row, point the agent at
`data/verify/_pool/<id>/`, inject the matching
`agent/skills/<agent>/<train_size>/SKILL.md` into the system prompt,
and record pass/fail against `agentsmith_fail2pass_<NNN>.py`. Also
run a *no-skill* baseline (same issue, same agent, SKILL.md removed)
so we can report per-skill lift.

### Key invariants
- 6 indices span **200 unique (repo, id) pairs**. Total unique issues
  is **192** because 8 ids collide across repos (e.g. `issue-563`,
  `issue-974` appear in two repos each). The pool shares one stripped
  dir per id, so the pool only has 192 entries — but the index still
  has 200 rows keyed by `(repo, id)`.
- All 6 indices have **identical issue-level train/test partition**
  (`seed=42`, `mode=repo_disjoint`). Only the **count** differs:
  | skill | train | test |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | `*_40`  | 47  | 153 |
  | `*_60`  | 71  | 129 |
  | `*_80`  | 121 | 79  |
  Repo leakage is **0%** for all 6.
- The verify pool's job is to make sure the agent **cannot read the
  gold patch**. The leak audit (`data/verify/audit.json`) currently
  reports `192/192 issues clean`. Every entry passes:
  - `absent:generated_patch.diff` — the gold diff file never copied;
  - `issue_json_no_patch_keys` — `linked_prs[].{patch, base_sha,
    head_sha}` all stripped;
  - `strict_3_file_invariant` — every verify dir contains exactly
    `env.dockerfile`, `issue.json`, and one
    `agentsmith_fail2pass_<NNN>.py`. Nothing else.

## 3. Suggested design for `utils/verify/solve.py`

This is a **sketch, not a contract**. Adapt to whatever runtime the
agent components actually need.

```
$ python utils/verify/solve.py --agent openhands --train-size 40 \
    --index data/verify/issue_index_openhands_40.jsonl \
    --split test --out results/verify/openhands_40.jsonl
```

Pseudocode:

```python
def main():
    index = load_jsonl(args.index)         # rows have .split, .id, .verify_dir, ...
    skill_dir = REPO_ROOT / "agent/skills" / args.agent / str(args.train_size)
    skill_md  = (skill_dir / "SKILL.md").read_text()
    baseline_md = (skill_dir / "fallback_generic_fix.md").read_text()
    results = []
    for row in index:
        if row["split"] != 1: continue        # solve only test
        pool_dir = REPO_ROOT / row["verify_dir"]
        test_file = pool_dir / Path(row["test_relpath"]).name
        # Two runs per issue: WITH the per-repo skill, and WITHOUT.
        for mode, sysprompt in [("skill", skill_md), ("baseline", baseline_md)]:
            outcome = run_agent(
                agent=args.agent,
                workdir=pool_dir,
                issue=load_issue_body(pool_dir / "issue.json"),
                system_prompt=sysprompt,
                test_file=test_file,
            )
            results.append({
                "id": row["id"], "repo": row["repo"], "category": row["category"],
                "mode": mode, "passed": outcome.passed,
                "agent_log": str(outcome.log_path),
                "wall_clock_s": outcome.wall_clock,
                "tokens_in": outcome.tokens_in, "tokens_out": outcome.tokens_out,
            })
    write_jsonl(args.out, results)
```

Key questions you need to answer before coding:

1. **How does the agent actually run?** Read `agent/run_mini.sh` and
   `agent/run_openhands.sh`; you will be calling them (or their
   underlying Python CLIs) from inside `solve.py`. Do not try to
   shell out to an LLM directly — the whole point is to test the
   **end-to-end** agent harness including tool use.
2. **What is the success signal?** The simplest definition is "the
   pre-existing `agentsmith_fail2pass_<NNN>.py` exits 0 after the
   agent's patch is applied". Look at how the train pipeline tests
   its smoke-test (`utils/train/train_skill.py --single-issue ...`)
   — it almost certainly already runs that test. Reuse the same
   runner. If no shared runner exists, write one inside `solve.py`
   that mounts the pool dir into a docker container with
   `env.dockerfile` and exits based on the pytest return code.
3. **Where do agent logs and patches go?** I suggest
   `results/verify/runs/<agent>/<train_size>/<mode>/<id>/{log,patch.diff,test.log}`
   so a single `results/verify/<agent>_<train_size>.jsonl` can point
   at the artefacts.
4. **Cost / time budget.** 6 skills × 153 test issues (the worst
   case, `train_size=40`) = ~918 runs *with* skill + 918 *without*
   = ~1.8k agent invocations. At ~2 minutes per run that is ~60
   hours of wall-clock. **Plan for parallelism early** — at least
   `--concurrency N`. Possibly also a `--limit 5` dry-run mode.

---

## 4. Known traps (these cost me time)

1. **The `utils/split/run.py` upstream bug.** `split()` dedupes by
   `id` (not `(repo, id)`), so 8 issues that share an id across two
   repos used to silently vanish from the test set. The verify index
   sidesteps this with a local `_split_repo_disjoint` keyed by
   `(repo, id)`. **Do not trust the train/test counts from
   `utils/split/run.py` — they will undercount by 8.** If you need
   to materialise a `train.jsonl` / `test.jsonl` outside of
   `build_verify.py`, use `_split_repo_disjoint` (it's defined in
   `build_verify.py`) or fix the upstream first.
2. **`issue_<NNN>.json`, not `issue.json`.** The raw dir's metadata
   file is named after the issue number — `issue_9.json`, not
   `issue.json`. `build_verify.py` normalises to `issue.json` in
   the pool, so your solver will find it under that name in
   `data/verify/_pool/<id>/`. Don't get confused by the raw dir
   naming.
3. **The pool has exactly 3 files per dir under `--strict`.** No
   `run.log`, no `summary.json`, no `f2p.txt`, no `dockerbuild.txt`,
   no `agentsmith_stat.json`. If you re-run without `--strict`
   (legacy mode) you will see all 7 files; release audits always use
   the default strict 3-file invariant. If you see `run.log`,
   `summary.json`, etc. in `_pool/`, something regenerated without
   `--strict` and you must rebuild.
4. **`*.hallucinated.*` validator rejects.** `utils/train/train_skill.py`
   writes a draft per-repo skill file, validates it, and on failure
   writes the bad draft as `repos/<owner>__<name>.md.hallucinated.<N>`
   and falls back to `fallback_generic_fix.md`. These files exist in
   `agent/skills/` (4 of them, one per skill that had a bad draft)
   but are now `.gitignore`d. If you re-run training and want to
   inspect a draft, look for `*.hallucinated.*`. The smoke-test runs
   live under `agent/skills/<agent>/1/` (train_size=1).
5. **`PYTHONPATH=.` is required** for `python utils/verify/build_verify.py`
   because `utils/__init__.py` does not exist (intentionally — utils
   is a flat package imported via `sys.path.insert`). Same will apply
   to your new `solve.py`.

---

## 5. Sanity checks before you ship Component 6

- `python utils/verify/build_verify.py --audit` → `192/192 issues clean`.
- All 6 indices pass:
  ```python
  import json
  from pathlib import Path
  indices = {}
  for p in sorted(Path("data/verify").glob("issue_index_*.jsonl")):
      name = p.stem.replace("issue_index_", "")
      indices[name] = {(r["repo"], r["id"]): r["split"] for r in (json.loads(l) for l in p.open())}
  # cross-agent same-size: 0 mismatches
  for sz in (40, 60, 80):
      diff = sum(1 for k in indices[f"mini-swe-agent_{sz}"] if indices[f"mini-swe-agent_{sz}"][k] != indices[f"openhands_{sz}"][k])
      assert diff == 0, f"size {sz}: {diff} cross-agent diffs"
  # monotonicity across sizes: 0 violations
  for sz_from, sz_to in [(40, 60), (40, 80), (60, 80)]:
      m_from = indices[f"mini-swe-agent_{sz_from}"]
      m_to   = indices[f"mini-swe-agent_{sz_to}"]
      viol = [k for k, v in m_from.items() if v == 0 and m_to.get(k) == 1]
      assert not viol, f"{sz_from}->{sz_to}: {len(viol)} monotonicity violations"
  print("OK")
  ```
- `du -sh data/verify/_pool/` reports ~4.6 MB. If it grows past
  ~6 MB, `--force-pool` was run without `--strict` and the
  `summary.json` / `run.log` filtering regressed — re-run with the
  default `--strict`.
- `data/verify/audit.json` should still have every entry marked
  `ok: true`, including the new `strict_3_file_invariant` check.

---

## 6. Open questions for the next agent

- **Cost ceiling.** How much wall-clock / $ are you allowed to spend
  on the full 1.8k-run sweep? The previous agent budgeted ~60 hours
  but never measured actual per-issue time. Run a 5-issue pilot
  first.
- **No-skill baseline: which fallback?** `SKILL.md` (per-repo
  skill) vs `fallback_generic_fix.md` (generic pattern). I
  recommended the latter for the baseline in the doc; you could
  also do *both* baselines (generic-fix only, fully bare prompt) to
  decompose the lift. Pick one and document it.
- **Where to write results.** I proposed
  `results/verify/<agent>_<train_size>.jsonl`. If you have a
  preferred structure, deviate and document.
- **What about the `single_issue` smoke-tests** in `agent/skills/<agent>/1/`?
  They were generated to verify the train pipeline end-to-end on
  one issue. The next agent may want to either delete them or
  include them in the manifest as a "test sanity" record. The
  previous agent left them in because they cost nothing and prove
  the train pipeline works.

## 7. Useful commands

```bash
# Verify pool is still valid
python utils/verify/build_verify.py --audit

# Inspect one test row
head -1 data/verify/issue_index_openhands_40.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool

# Inspect what an agent will see
ls data/verify/_pool/issue-1077/
cat data/verify/_pool/issue-1077/issue.json

# See the SKILL.md the agent will be given
cat agent/skills/openhands/40/SKILL.md | head -40

# Re-run the train pipeline if a skill looks wrong
FORCE=1 bash utils/train/run_all.sh
```

---

*End of handoff. The previous agent is gone; you are now the
author of Component 6. Good luck.*
