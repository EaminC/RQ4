# Split sweep — train_size sweep × 3 repeats × mode

Usable issues (with valid A–F category): **200**

## Strategies

### Strategy A — `default` (bounded per-repo cap)
1. Compute per-category seed quotas via **largest-remainder rounding** (snake / serpentine recall-merge), one issue per quota slot.
2. For each category, prefer an issue from a repo we have not yet claimed; fall back to an already-claimed repo only if the unclaimed pool is exhausted.
3. After the seed phase, for every claimed repo R, pull in additional issues up to a per-repo cap `m_R = round(train_size / |claimed_repos|)` (largest-remainder rounding so the total stays near `train_size`).

**Goal**: train size ≈ requested, broad repo coverage, low-but-not-zero leakage. On this 200-issue / 11-repo dataset leakage is essentially 100% because the cap is a few issues per repo, not the whole repo.

### Strategy B — `repo_disjoint` (strict, whole-repo isolation)
1. Decide how many repos `N` to claim: choose the smallest `N` such that `Σ issue_counts[claimed_repos] ≥ train_size`.
2. Move **every** issue from each of those `N` repos to train; everything else goes to test.
3. By construction, `test_repo_leakage_pct == 0`.

**Goal**: zero contamination between train and test. Trade-off: actual train size is coarse (whole repos), so it jumps in steps and is rarely equal to the requested size.

### Strategy C — `greedy_issue` (issue-level greedy)
1. Snake through the **6 categories × 11 repos** cross-tab; at each step pick an issue from the next (repo, category) cell.
2. If we still need more issues to hit `train_size`, top up from the smallest-claimed-repo pool.

**Goal**: hit `train_size` exactly, maximise coverage of both repos and categories. Trade-off: once we exhaust the fresh-repo pool we must reuse claimed repos, so leakage is no longer guaranteed to be 0.
