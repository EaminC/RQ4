"""Stratified, repo-disjoint train/test split.

Given an index JSONL produced by ``utils/classify``, produce a train/test
pair such that:

1. **Stratification**: the train set contains at least one issue from
   every category present in the index (snake/serpentine recall-merge
   allocation — largest-remainder rounding of proportional quotas).
2. **Repo disjointness (best-effort)**: if an issue from repo R is in
   train, *most other* issues from R also land in train. We pick a
   per-repo cap ``m_r`` that scales with the seed-quota so the final
   train size is close to ``--train-size`` while still pulling in
   enough sibling issues per repo to meaningfully prevent leakage.

Algorithm overview
------------------

Phase 1 — *Stratified seed*:

For each category with quota ``q_c = round(train_size * n_c / N)``,
we prefer issues from repos we have not yet claimed (widens coverage),
then fall back to already-claimed repos. This guarantees the seed
covers every category present in the data.

Phase 2 — *Bounded repo propagation*:

Each claimed repo R contributes up to ``m_R = max(1, round(train_size
/ |claimed|))`` issues to train (rounded down so the total stays at or
below ``train_size``). This satisfies "sibling issues from the same
repo usually land together" without swallowing the whole dataset when
the repo pool is small.

The split is reproducible given ``--seed``.

Usage::
